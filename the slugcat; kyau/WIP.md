an actual story! about a slugcat named Kyau. i intend for it to be as realistic a depiction of a slugcat's life as possible, not skipping over any parts of the story, even if it isn't "plot relevant".

to make it realistic, i'm writing it from beginning to end without a plot in mind. anything that happens previously in life should have at least a small effect on the future
