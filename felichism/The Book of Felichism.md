Felichism
BEGIN THE TEXT OF FELICHISM:
============
The term "religion" typically invokes a feeling different to the feelings Felichism is intended to create. Religion often contains gods, argument, and story; however, while Felichism takes the name of a religion, it is not like many others.

Felichism does not name any god nor mention any deity, however any may believe in a god if they choose, and Felichism does not vow against it.

The name "Felichism" comes from the Esperanto "feliÄ‰a", meaning "happy". Under this introduction will be a list of philosophies designed not to replace, nor to invoke any anger.
